# Vectorscope_GuyFawkes

A reimplementation of the Vectorscope from https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/Vectorscope

This version is simply called Vectorscope_GuyFawkes for no other reason other than to identify it from the various other implementations, since it was created on a November.

This version was created using KiCad without importing any schematic or PCB or Gerber files, since I didn't know of a way to do that. No guarantee it will work!
